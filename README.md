## Code Details

The Deer Ma.mq5 code is designed to provide trading signals based on moving averages. It uses two customizable parameters, FastMA_Period and SlowMA_Period, to calculate fast and slow moving averages.

The code follows a structured approach and includes necessary comments to explain each section. Here is a breakdown of the code:

### Customizable Parameters

The following parameters can be customized in the code:

- FastMA_Period: Period for the fast moving average.
- SlowMA_Period: Period for the slow moving average.

### Global Variables

The code uses the following global variables:

- fastMA: An array to store the values of the fast moving average.
- slowMA: An array to store the values of the slow moving average.

### Initialization

The OnInit() function is called during the initialization phase. In this function, the ArraySetAsSeries() function is used to set the arrays as series.

### Start Function

The OnTick() function is called on every tick. It checks the number of bars and returns if it is less than the specified moving average periods.

The function then resizes the fastMA and slowMA arrays based on the number of bars.

Moving averages are calculated using the CopyBuffer() function. The trade signals are determined based on the comparison of the current and previous values of the moving averages.

If the fast moving average is above the slow moving average in the current bar and below it in the previous bar, a buy trade is opened. If the fast moving average is below the slow moving average in the current bar and above it in the previous bar, a sell trade is opened.

### Deinitialization

The OnDeinit() function is called during the deinitialization phase. It closes any open orders by looping through each order and using the OrderClose() function.
